//
//  Tutorial.swift
//  King Krab
//
//  The guided first game. A new player is walked through the arena one step at
//  a time: smashing the wrong crabs, letting the right one reach the King, what
//  a mistake costs, the two helper crabs and the golden streak — after which the
//  level simply carries on as an ordinary session.
//
//  The tutorial never re-implements a rule. Each step only *shapes* what the
//  arena sends in (`CrabTutorialPlan`) and listens for the one thing that step
//  is waiting for; scoring, lives and rounds keep running through `MemoryGame`
//  exactly as they do in a normal game. That is what makes the tutorial a real
//  session rather than a scripted demo: the shells the player collects here
//  count, and the level continues from where the last step leaves it.
