//  All of the app's sound in one place:
//   - looping background music while a game is being played,
//   - the correct / wrong answer sound effects,
//   - the sums read aloud in every app language with a system voice, and
//   - small Apple-native tap sounds for the menus.
//
//  The start/pause card exposes music/effects and spoken sums as two independent
//  controls. Speech is offered only when the device has a matching system voice
//  for the language selected inside the app.
